# PiSpy
PiSpy is a home security app that uses a raspberry pi to monitor an environment.
The app was created with Flutter using Dartlang and the server was created with Flask using python.

## How it works?
Using a 3rd party motion tracking software __Motion__, I was able to capture imagees, video, and also a livestream of of whatever the camera was viewing. This data was sent back to the app through a server using Flask. This allowed for all the files created by the Raspberry Pi to be easily viewed on a mobile device.
